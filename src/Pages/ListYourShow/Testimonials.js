                                We at Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival with Star are proud of our
                                partnership with BMS. They turned around the registration to
                                the festival and the on ground management of delegates at our
                                venues altering visitor experience at the festival which is
                                the cornerstone of engagement at any LIVE event. BMS is an
                                integral part of building MAMI and its growth in the last 6
                                years. Despite being a huge corporate their commitment to
                                independent institutions in cultural spaces is unflinching.
                                Our gratitude to Ashish Hemrajani and his team at BMS for
                                their faith and support.”
